#reflection
While creating the program, I tried to experiment with using different types of arrays and implementing them to make 
my program more efficient. Initially, I struggled with some of the logic when creating the program, especially with 
figuring out how to balance chemical equations. However, through the process of trial and error and working with different 
chemical formulas, I was able to figure it out and I was also able to use similar logic in other parts of my program. I tried 
to apply some subroutines from the last module and found it very useful when checking imputed values and adding extra 
features, such as giving the option to calculate again and with the start menu. Furthermore, I tried to challenge myself to go 
beyond solving for the highlighted columns, and tried to solve for the column of group 1 ions. After working through this program, I 
felt like I became more comfortable with using python syntax than the last module and have also become more familiar with arrays and 
applying them in programming.
